# üöÄ Android App Optimizer TUI - Complete Setup Guide

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for setting up and using the Android App Optimizer, a powerful Textual-based TUI for optimizing Android applications.

The tool offers two distinct methods for operation, each catering to different user needs:
1.  **üî• Root-based**: For users with rooted devices, offering direct and powerful system access.
2.  **üíß Shizuku-based**: For non-root users, leveraging the Shizuku framework for elevated permissions.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure your environment meets the following requirements.

### General Requirements
- **Python**: Version 3.7+
- **PIP**: For installing Python packages.
- **Git**: For cloning the repository.

### Method 1: Root-based
- **Android Device**: A **rooted** Android device is mandatory.
- **Execution Environment**:
    - **On-Device (Recommended)**: [Termux](https://termux.dev/en/) app installed on your Android device. The script will use `su` to gain root privileges.
    - **From a PC**: `adb` installed and configured. You must have passwordless `sudo` access if you intend to run ADB commands that require root.

### Method 2: Shizuku-based
- **Android Device**:
    - [Shizuku](https://shizuku.rikka.app/) app installed, running, and properly configured.
    - [Termux](https://termux.dev/en/) app installed.
- **Termux-Shizuku Integration**: You must grant Termux permission to access Shizuku.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    Open your terminal and clone the project files.
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd Android-APPS-OPTIMIZE
    ```

2.  **Install Python Dependencies**
    The required Python libraries are listed in `requirements.txt`. Install them using pip.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    Or, to install them manually with the latest specified versions:
    ```bash
    pip install "textual>=0.60.0" "rich>=13.7.0" "pexpect>=4.9.0"
    ```
    > **Note**: The new Textual TUI versions do not use `questionary`.

3.  **Make Scripts Executable**
    Grant execution permissions to the Python scripts for easier use.
    ```bash
    chmod +x optimize-apps-root-tui.py optimize-apps-shizuku-tui.py
    ```

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

Both scripts feature an identical, modern Textual interface for a seamless user experience.

### Method 1: Using `optimize-apps-root-tui.py` (üî• Root)

This script is designed for rooted devices and offers a robust way to perform optimizations.

**To Run the Application:**
```bash
./optimize-apps-root-tui.py
```
or
```bash
python3 optimize-apps-root-tui.py
```

**TUI Workflow:**
1.  **Connection**: The script automatically detects if it's running in Termux (using `su`) or on a PC (using `sudo`). It will then request root access.
2.  **App Listing**: A list of user-installed apps appears, grouped by optimization status and color-coded for clarity.
3.  **App Selection**:
    - Use `‚Üë` and `‚Üì` arrow keys to navigate.
    - Press `Space` to toggle selection for an app.
    - Press `A` to select all filtered apps, and `D` to deselect all.
    - Use the search bar at the top to filter the app list in real-time.
    - Press `Enter` to confirm your selection.
4.  **Profile Selection**: Choose the desired optimization profile. `everything` is generally the fastest, while `space` is best for saving storage.
5.  **Optimization**: A progress bar and log will show the real-time status of the optimization process.
6.  **Summary**: After completion, a summary screen displays the results and provides post-optimization options.

### Method 2: Using `optimize-apps-shizuku-tui.py` (üíß Shizuku)

This script uses Shizuku, making it perfect for non-rooted devices where Shizuku is set up.

**To Run the Application:**
Ensure you are in a terminal (like Termux) where Shizuku is accessible.
```bash
./optimize-apps-shizuku-tui.py
```
or
```bash
python3 optimize-apps-shizuku-tui.py
```

**TUI Workflow:**
The user interface and workflow are **identical** to the root-based version. The script handles the Shizuku connection in the background.

## üîÑ Post-Optimization Steps

### ‚ÄºÔ∏è IMPORTANT: REBOOT REQUIRED ‚ÄºÔ∏è

After optimizing apps, **you MUST reboot your device**.

- **Why?** The optimization process can interfere with Android's Scoped Storage permissions. A reboot is necessary to fix these permissions and ensure apps can access their storage correctly.
- **Persistence**: All optimizations are permanent and will persist across reboots.

The summary screen in the TUI provides a convenient button to reboot the device immediately.

---

## üí° Performance & Optimization Tips

- **Batch Optimization**: Select and optimize multiple apps at once. The TUI is designed for this and it's much faster than optimizing one by one.
- **Profile Choice**:
    - For maximum performance, use `speed-profile` or `everything`.
    - For devices with limited storage, use `space` or `space-profile`.
- **Run During Idle Time**: The optimization process can be resource-intensive. Run it when you are not actively using your device for the best results.
- **Verify Status**: After rebooting, you can use the `optimization-status.sh` script (run inside Termux with Shizuku or root) to verify the new optimization status of your apps.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### General Issues
- **"ModuleNotFoundError" / "ImportError"**: You haven't installed the required dependencies. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- **UI Looks Garbled**: Your terminal may not fully support the characters used by Textual. Ensure you are using a modern terminal emulator like Termux, Kitty, or Windows Terminal.

### Root-based Method (`optimize-apps-root-tui.py`)
- **"Failed to connect with sudo"**: If running from a PC, this means the script couldn't get root access non-interactively. Ensure you have configured **passwordless sudo** for your user.
- **Errors During Optimization**:
    1. Check the log file `root_optimizer.log` for detailed error messages.
    2. Run the script with the `--diagnose` flag for a full checkup of your environment:
       ```bash
       ./optimize-apps-root-tui.py --diagnose
       ```

### Shizuku-based Method (`optimize-apps-shizuku-tui.py`)
- **"Error connecting to Shizuku"**:
    - Verify that the Shizuku app is running on your Android device.
    - Open the Shizuku app and check if Termux is listed and authorized.
    - Try restarting the Shizuku service from within the app.
- **"Command timed out"**:
    - Your device may be under heavy load. Try again later or optimize fewer apps at once.
    - This can happen with very large apps. The default timeout is high, but older devices may struggle.
- **Errors During Optimization**: Check the log file `shizuku_optimizer.log` for detailed error messages from the Shizuku service.
